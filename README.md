## Features

- some atumated functions for managing constraints in multiple bones that should be in blender but that goes beyong me

- a set of custom widgets so your goofy ahh' rigs are not only using circles

- console messages written in pirate slang to inform if you shot yourself on the foot

-  a custom shelf with a couple automated rig generations

- set of functions in different files for other unhinged riggers who would like to auotmate their rigs without having to use riggify's 10 year old design pattern
