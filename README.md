# unorthodox-rigging-tools
somewhat unorthodox tools to aid rigging in blender 

made by chair man xi the artgineer while working on a custom rig using mixamo skelleton as base.

its pretyy much straight forward, you may only rename the deforming skeleton. try weight painting before generating the rig and i think all be fine

as a tip. set deforming bones parented to other deforming bones, those are the ones you'll be exporting if so. 

be aware of the "remove all constrains. it only works when bone selected but try not to click it when renmaing stuff plese, will add better menus later

thats it for now.
